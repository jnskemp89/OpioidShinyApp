# Opioid Analysis App

## This app is meant to quickly and succinctly display the number of precriptions coming from each state.

## Prescription counts for every state are broken down by drug type, with the ability to filter for male and female prescribers. The quick view format would be very useful for finding problem areas and displaying whether certain demographics of physicians are more apt to use opioids than others.
